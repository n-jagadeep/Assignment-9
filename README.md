Using the py code provided first we save the model and load the model with new text to predict the result

To use GridSearchCV for tuning hyperparameters, defining a grid of parameters and perform a grid search for the best parameters. However, since Keras models don't directly work with GridSearchCV from scikit-learn, so have to use KerasClassifier or KerasRegressor wrappers for Keras models to use with GridSearchCV.
